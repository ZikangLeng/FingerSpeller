# FingerSpeller

Sensor readings from the accelerometer are available for all three participants in the data directory. The data comprises 15 dimensions, organized by finger (thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinky), with each finger having xyz readings. The sensor was sampled at a rate of 200 Hz. The corresponding label file provides the word label for the sensor data, with "sil" indicating periods of silence at the beginning and end of each recording.
